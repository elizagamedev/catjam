Getting Familiar
----------------

Available for download from itch.io [1].

As a witch's familiar in training, you have only a month left before your final
exam held in the small American town of Sablewood. You'll get to know a host of
other charming (and not so charming) familiars along the way.

Features beautiful traditional paintings by Jeanie Choi and adorable character
illustrations by M Ebel.
